Make a cool looking Sci Fi dashboard UI as a replacement for bootstrap with own styles (no use of bootstrap) that has similar elements (but isn't limited to).

Below is the list of ui elements that we add for information. IMPORTANT: We don't implemment them all now, cause the code may become too large for implementing it all at once. First: Start by adding some basic styles as well as the tool classes and a sample html page. Don't add any layout or page elements yet, but make the basic styles in a way so that we can easily add them later step by step. Then stop for now.
