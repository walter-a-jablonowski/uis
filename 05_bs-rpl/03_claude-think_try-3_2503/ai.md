Make a cool looking Sci Fi dashboard UI as a replacement for bootstrap with own styles (no use of bootstrap) that has similar elements (but isn't limited to).

For now we will make only the basic html with no layout elements, forms or components yet.

Start by only adding some basic styles as well as the tool classes below and a basic sample html page.


Tools
----------------------------------------------------------

- horizontal and vertical alignment
- spacing
- borders
- colors (border, background, text)
- display
