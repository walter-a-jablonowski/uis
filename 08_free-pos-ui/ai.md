UI frameworks usually use rectangluar page structure and ui elements which is kind of boring. Better would be:

- each UI element can placed freely on the page
  - when the page size changes, position and size of ui element must change as well
  - keep a minumim size per ui element that makes sense
- beside rectangular controls we also might use some with more intersting shapes
