Make a cool looking Sci Fi dashboard UI as a replacement for bootstrap with own styles (no use of bootstrap) that has similar elements (but isn't limited to). At least add:

- nav bar and status bar
  - nav bar: has nice logo and a text on the left
- sidebars
  - right sidebar: add a button the the header bar right aligned to hide it
- grid system
- widgets
- controls
  - input
  - input group
  - select
  - switch
  - range control
  - buttons
  - button group
  - dropdown
  - progress
- breadcrumb
- collapse
- list group
- modal
- tabs
- popover
- spinner
- toast

Maybe add some cool elements that are missing in this list.

Tools

- horizontal and vertical alignment
- spacing
- colors
- display
- borders
