Make a cool looking Sci Fi dashboard UI as a replacement for bootstrap with own styles (no use of bootstrap) that has similar elements (but isn't limited to).

Below is the list of elements we add at least. IMPORTANT: Add only one at a time, it may be too much code at once.

First: Look through the list below and start by adding some basic styles first as well as the tool classes. Then ask me for confirmation. Then add one ui element at a time and update the html sample page and ask me for confirmation before each new ui element, so that can review the result first and save it to git.
